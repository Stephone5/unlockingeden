        Four years ago I fell in love with the people of Haiti. I went on my<br>
      first mission trip and was captivated by their beauty and joy. After returning<br>
      home I prayed that God would reveal to me what my calling was. He laid the words<br>
      "Homes for Haiti" on my heart, followed with the number 1,000 homes. Since then<br>
      I have been back two more times and have always held onto this vision He gave me. </p>

      <h1>Homes for Haiti</h1>
      <p id="H4H-text"> Unlocking Eden is a ministry organization designed to bring heaven on
      earth, to be a reflection of the garden. This is done by following
      Christâ€™s calling to heal the afflicted and care for the poor by turning
      trash into housing, offering employment which grows self worth, and
      transforming whole villages from a few hospitable homes, which allows
      people to become their full selves by living into who God has called them
      to be.  By this act of love, the people live in a rich relationship with
      the father and thriving communities are created.

    <section id="Contact">
      <h1>Contact</h1>
      <p id="Contact-text"> The first project Unlocking Eden will focus on is Homes
      for Haiti.This project will be executed through the process of collecting
      trash, creating panels out of the waste, and then building homes out of
      the recycled building material. This would be done through a franchise
      with EcoDom- each home takes 7 days to build and is sold for $300.
      This partnership promises affordable homes, an increase in employment,
      and transformed streets. We believe a franchise with EcoDom is the most
      feasible way in meeting the needs for empowerment and sustainability
      within the nation of Haiti.
