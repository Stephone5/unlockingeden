          "Unlocking Eden aims to bring Heaven to Earth by equipping others to
          step into the fullness of their identity and to experience the life of
           abundance we're promised. We are united by the passion to bring
           Christ's kingdom to Earth and to walk in communion everyday; just
           like the garden."

          Benjamin: "Hi! My name is Benjamin Ramer, I am from west Tennessee.
          I love good coffee, concerts, and my dog. I one day hope to be an
          architect to build things and incorporate ministry in my passion for
          design! I enjoy finding ways to interweave God's plan with businesses
          and life which is why I am at Global U now."

          Kareena: "I am 18 years old and from North Carolina. I have a heart
          to carry the light and hope of Christ into situations that aren't
          initially seen as beautiful. And I have a deep desire to bring His
          eyes of perspective into everything I do."

          Stephen: "I am 18 and I am from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I like to
          draw out possible inventions and develop ideas for businesses in my
          spare time. My favorite thing about God is that he always accepts me
          back after I have run away, no matter the reason. Lastly, my favorite
          verse is Psalms 23 saying "Though I walk through the valley of the
          shadow of death I will fear no evil for your rod and your staff they
          comfort me."

      <h1>Homes for Haiti</h1>
        <p>
          Homes for Haiti follows Christ's calling to heal the afflicted and
          care for the poor by turning trash into housing, offering employment
          which grows self worth, and transforming whole villages from a few
          hospitable homes, which allows people to become their full selves
          by living into who God has called them to be. By this act of love,
          the people live in a rich relationship with the father and thriving
          communities are created.
